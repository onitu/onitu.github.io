### Setup

If you want to build the website, you'll need NodeJS. It's not required at runtime, but only for the building process. If you have NodeJS installed, you can run the following commands:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/onitu/onitu.github.io.git
$ cd onitu.github.io
$ sudo npm install -g gulp # only needed if don't have Gulp installed
$ npm install
```

Then, you can run `gulp` to compile the assets and launch the livereload server. You can access the website at [http://localhost:8080]().
